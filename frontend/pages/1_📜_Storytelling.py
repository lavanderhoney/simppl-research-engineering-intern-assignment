    1:"""This chart shows the number of posts over time across various political subreddits, using a 15-day rolling average to smooth trends. From August 2024 to early 2025, post activity remained low and stable, but around January-February 2025, some subreddits saw a sharp increase, likely due to a major political event.
Key trends:
Politics and socialism subreddits had the biggest spikes.
Democrats and Republican subreddits also grew but more gradually.
PoliticalDiscussion stayed more stable.
When to use this chart:
To analyze online political engagement trends before major events.
To compare subreddit activity over time in response to political changes.
To track how different political communities react to events.""",
2:""" This chart shows how different topic themes are distributed across each political subreddit, using stacked bars to represent the percentage of posts. Each bar (labeled by subreddit on the x-axis) is divided into color-coded segments for topics like personal perspectives on socialism, public opinion on Trump, online racial group dynamics, and more.

Key points:

Each subreddit has a unique topic mix, reflecting community interests (e.g., one may focus more on socialism, another on budget policy).
Bars add up to 100% per subreddit, making it easy to compare dominant conversation themes at a glance.
When to use:

To compare topic focus across political communities.
To understand how different subreddits prioritize or discuss certain political themes.
To spot community-specific trends in political discourse.""",
3: """ This visualization is a network diagram showing how different political subreddits are connected based on their relationships (e.g., shared discussions or user overlap). Each node is a subreddit, and the lines between them represent the strength or frequency of their connections.

Key points:

Nodes closer together or with thicker lines tend to have stronger connections or more shared interest.
Each node is color-coded, making it easy to distinguish subreddits at a glance.
The structure highlights clusters of closely related communities.
When to use:

To see how different political subreddits relate to each other.
To identify clusters or groups that share common topics.
To explore how online communities overlap or diverge in their political discussions.""",

The y-axis shows the **number of posts** at each sentiment level. Notably, there‚Äôs a **tall bar** at **0**, indicating that **most posts** are neutral or close to neutral in sentiment, with fewer posts at the more **positive** or **negative** ends of the scale.

**Key points:**
- **Peak around 0:** Most posts have a **neutral** sentiment.
- **Smaller bars** at both ends: Relatively fewer posts show **strongly positive** or **strongly negative** sentiment.

**When to use:**
- To quickly see how **positive, negative, or neutral** a set of posts is.
- To understand the **overall tone** of conversations in political subreddits.
- As a **starting point** for deeper analysis into why certain posts lean more positive or negative. """,

Key points:  
- Each row represents a subreddit, each column a **range of sentiment scores** (from negative to positive).  
- The **color scale** shows how many posts fall into each sentiment range.  
- You can quickly see **which sentiment ranges** are most common for each subreddit.  

When to use:  
- To **compare** the **sentiment distribution** across multiple subreddits.  
- To identify which subreddits have **higher negative or positive** sentiment.  
- To **spot trends** in overall tone across different communities. """,

Early on, sentiment appears to **fluctuate** with both positive and negative swings. Over time, it tends to **stabilize** closer to **neutral** (around zero), suggesting that overall conversation mood levels out toward the end of the period.

**Key points:**
- **Time-based changes** in sentiment, with notable ups and downs early on.
- Gradual **stabilization** near a neutral score.

**When to use:**
- To understand **how sentiment shifts** over a specific time frame.
- To **identify periods** of heightened negativity or positivity.

Each bar is divided into sections for subreddits like Conservative, Liberal, Republican, etc., revealing **which communities** share **which sources** most often.

**When to use:**
- To see how **domain popularity** varies by subreddit.  
- To compare **media source usage** across different political communities.  
- To spot **patterns or preferences** in news-sharing behavior.""",

For instance, **youtube.com** has the largest share, followed by **self.Conservative**, then various news sites like **nytimes.com**, **thehill.com**, and **apnews.com**.

**Key points:**
- It gives a **quick overview** of which domains are most popular.
- It highlights the **dominance** of certain domains compared to others.
- It shows **relative proportions** rather than absolute numbers.

**When to use:**
- To **spot top domains** or sources in an overall dataset.
